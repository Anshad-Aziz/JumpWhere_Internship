1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included)
result=[num for num in range (1500,2700) if num%5==0 and num%7==0]

print(result)
2. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
Note : Use 'continue' statement.
Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5
for num in range(7):
    if num==3 or num==6:
        continue
    print(num,end=" ")
3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
Buzz
for i in range(1,50):
    if i%3==0 and i%5==0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
    elif i%3==0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i%5==0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
4. Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Note :
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal sides.
Expected Output:
Input lengths of the triangle sides:                                    
x: 6                                                                    
y: 8                                                                    
z: 12                                                                   
Scalene triangle 
def triangle(x,y,z):
    if x==y==z:
        print("equilateral triangle")
    elif x==y or y==z or z==x:
        print("isosceles triangle")
    else:
        print("Scalene triangle")
        
x=int(input("Enter the side"))
y=int(input("Enter the side"))
z=int(input("Enter the side"))

triangle(x,y,z)
