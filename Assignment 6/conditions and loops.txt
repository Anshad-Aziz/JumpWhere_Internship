3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
Buzz
for i in range(1,50):
    if i%3==0 and i%5==0:
        print("fizzbuzz")

4. Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Note :
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal sides.
Expected Output:
Input lengths of the triangle sides:                                    
x: 6                                                                    
y: 8                                                                    
z: 12                                                                   
Scalene triangle 
def triangle(x,y,z):
    if x==y==z:
        print("equilateral triangle")
    elif x==y or y==z or z==x:
        print("isosceles triangle")
    else:
        print("Scalene triangle")
        
x=int(input("Enter the side"))
y=int(input("Enter the side"))
z=int(input("Enter the side"))

triangle(x,y,z)      

6. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested loop number.
1
22
333
4444
55555
666666
7777777
88888888
999999999
for i in range(1,10):
    print(str(i)*i)
7. Write a Python program that counts the number of elements within a list that are greater than 30.
def count(lst):
    count=sum(1 for num in lst if num>30)
    return count

lst=list(map(int, input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))

print(count(lst))
8. Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from user and check if it is square or not.
length=float(input("Enter the length"))
breath=float(input("Enter the breath"))

if length==breath:
    print("It is a Square")
else:
    print("Not a square")

9. A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.
Ask user for quantity
Suppose, one unit will cost 100.
Judge and print total cost for user.
quantity =int(input("Enter the quantity"))

unit=100

cost=quantity*unit

if cost>1000:
    discount=cost*0.10
    cost-=discount

print(cost) 

10. A company decided to give bonus of 5% to employee if his/her year of service is more than 5 years.
Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net bonus amount.
salary=int(input("Enter the salary"))
